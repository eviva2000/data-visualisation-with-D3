# data-visualisation-with-D3

This repository contains my experimental projects where I explore and learn various data visualization techniques using D3.js. D3.js (Data-Driven Documents) is a powerful JavaScript library for creating dynamic, interactive data visualizations in web browsers. These experiments showcase my journey in understanding D3.js through hands-on practice.

Setup

To run these visualizations locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/eviva2000/data-visualisation-with-D3.git
```
2. Run d3.html using "Live server" extension.
3. Change the javascript source to view all examples.
   
Below is a list of the visualizations included in this repository. Each visualization is an experiment with different D3.js features and techniques.
- Line graph
- Interpolations
- Tree structure
- Bar charts
