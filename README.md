# data-visualisation-with-D3

This repository contains my experimental projects where I explore and learn various data visualization techniques using D3.js. D3.js (Data-Driven Documents) is a powerful JavaScript library for creating dynamic, interactive data visualizations in web browsers. These experiments showcase my journey in understanding D3.js through hands-on practice.

Below is a list of the visualizations included in this repository. Each visualization is an experiment with different D3.js features and techniques.
- Line graph
- Interpolations
- Tree structure
- Bar charts
